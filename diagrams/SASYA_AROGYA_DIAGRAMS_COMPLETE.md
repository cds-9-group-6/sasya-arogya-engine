### System Architecture Diagrams

#### Diagram 01 - Application Architecture
The Application Architecture diagram presents the complete technical architecture of the Sasya Arogya Engine, showcasing a seven-layer stack from client applications to infrastructure components. The visualization demonstrates clear data flow through the API Gateway Layer, Core Engine, AI/ML Services, and External Services, with dedicated Observability and Infrastructure layers providing monitoring and deployment support. Each layer is color-coded using the Sasya Arogya green theme and properly spaced to ensure readability, with straight arrows indicating primary data flow paths and dotted lines showing observability and infrastructure connections. This diagram serves as the foundational reference for understanding the system's component relationships and data movement patterns.

#### Diagram 02 - LangGraph Workflow State Machine
The LangGraph Workflow State Machine diagram illustrates the complete finite state machine implementation that orchestrates user interactions through the agricultural intelligence platform. The visualization shows 12 distinct states including START, INITIAL, CLASSIFYING, PRESCRIBING, INSURANCE, VENDOR_QUERY, SHOW_VENDORS, ORDER_BOOKING, FOLLOWUP, COMPLETED, ERROR, and END states, with 24 labeled transitions between them. The diagram uses the Sasya Arogya green color scheme to distinguish state types (process, service, error, terminal) and employs curved arrows with clear labels to show the decision flow from user input through disease classification, treatment prescription, insurance calculation, and vendor selection. This state machine ensures robust conversation management and prevents infinite loops while providing multiple pathways for user interaction completion.

### MCP Integration Diagrams

#### Diagram 11 - MCP Integration Architecture
The MCP Integration Architecture diagram presents the complete technical integration between the LangGraph finite state machine workflow engine and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, showcasing a multi-layered architecture from client applications to external data sources. The visualization demonstrates clear data flow through the FastAPI server, LangGraph FSM engine, intent analysis system, and MCP server tools, with dedicated layers for external services and data processing. Each layer is color-coded using the Sasya Arogya green theme and properly spaced to ensure readability, with straight arrows indicating primary data flow paths and clear separation between client, engine, MCP, and external service layers. This diagram serves as the foundational reference for understanding the complete system integration and service communication patterns.

#### Diagram 12 - Insurance Premium Calculation Flow
The Insurance Premium Calculation Flow diagram illustrates the complete sequence of operations for calculating crop insurance premiums, from user input through MCP server processing to final response delivery. The visualization shows 12 distinct interaction steps including user input processing, LangGraph FSM routing, LLM-powered intent analysis, MCP server communication, premium calculation with government subsidies, and result streaming. The diagram uses the Sasya Arogya green theme with clear participant labels and detailed annotations to show the decision flow from user request through intent disambiguation, context extraction, MCP tool execution, and premium calculation with subsidy application. This sequence diagram ensures comprehensive understanding of the premium calculation process and serves as technical documentation for developers and business stakeholders.
