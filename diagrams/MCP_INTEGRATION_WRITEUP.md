- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback mechanisms for failed operations

### 2. MCP Server Integration Layer

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides specialized insurance services:

```python
# MCP Server Tools Available
- calculate_crop_premium: Premium calculation with government subsidies
- generate_insurance_certificate: PDF policy document generation
- get_insurance_companies: Company comparison and selection
- recommend_insurance: AI-powered policy recommendations
```

**Integration Benefits:**
- **Microservice Architecture**: Decoupled insurance services for scalability
- **Protocol Standardization**: Consistent API across all insurance operations
- **Resource Management**: Efficient handling of PDF generation and data processing
- **External Service Integration**: Seamless connection to government and insurance APIs

### 3. Intent Analysis System

The system features a sophisticated multi-layer intent analysis:

#### Layer 1: Initial Intent Classification
```python
# Primary intent detection
if "insurance" in user_message:
    route_to_insurance_node()
elif "treatment" in user_message:
    route_to_treatment_node()
```

#### Layer 2: LLM-Powered Sub-Intent Analysis
```python
# Advanced sub-intent disambiguation using ChatPromptTemplate
INSURANCE_ACTION_PROMPT = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are an expert insurance analyst. Analyze the user's message and determine whether they want to:

1. **CALCULATE_PREMIUM** - They want to know the cost/price/premium of insurance
2. **GENERATE_CERTIFICATE** - They want to buy/purchase insurance or generate a certificate
3. **GET_COMPANIES** - They want to know about insurance companies
4. **RECOMMEND** - They want insurance recommendations

CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION RULES:
1. "How much does it cost to buy insurance?" ‚Üí CALCULATE_PREMIUM (asking about cost)
2. "Buy insurance with this cost" ‚Üí GENERATE_CERTIFICATE (ready to purchase)
""")
```

#### Layer 3: Context-Aware Action Determination
```python
# Intelligent action selection based on conversation history
def _determine_insurance_action(self, state: WorkflowState, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    user_intent = state.get("user_intent", {})
    
    if user_intent.get("wants_insurance_premium"):
        return "calculate_premium"
    elif user_intent.get("wants_insurance_purchase"):
        return "generate_certificate"
    # ... additional logic
```

## üîÑ Insurance Premium Calculation Flow

### Technical Implementation

The premium calculation process demonstrates the sophisticated integration between LangGraph and MCP:

1. **User Input Processing**
   ```python
   # User: "What is the cost of premium for my wheat farm?"
   user_message = "What is the cost of premium for my wheat farm?"
   session_id = "premium-calc-session"
   ```

2. **Intent Analysis & Routing**
   ```python
   # LangGraph FSM processes the request
   initial_node ‚Üí followup_node ‚Üí insurance_node
   
   # LLM analyzes sub-intent
   llm_response = {
       "action": "insurance",
       "confidence": 0.95,
       "wants_insurance_premium": True
   }
   ```

3. **Context Extraction**
   ```python
   # Extract insurance context from conversation
   insurance_context = {
       "crop": "wheat",
       "area_hectare": 2.5,
       "state": "Punjab",
       "farmer_name": "John"
   }
   ```

4. **MCP Server Communication**
   ```python
   # Prepare MCP tool call
   mcp_payload = {
       "name": "calculate_crop_premium",
       "arguments": {
           "crop": "wheat",
           "area_hectare": 2.5,
           "state": "Punjab"
       }
   }
   
   # Execute via HTTP client
   response = requests.post(
       f"{mcp_server_url}/tools/call",
       json=mcp_payload,
       timeout=30
   )
   ```

5. **Premium Calculation & Response**
   ```python
   # MCP server calculates premium with government subsidies
   premium_result = {
       "premium_details": "‚Çπ9,375 (Farmer) + ‚Çπ28,125 (Government)",
       "total_premium": "‚Çπ37,500",
       "subsidy_percentage": "75%",
       "coverage_amount": "‚Çπ112,500"
   }
   
   # Stream response to user
   stream_response(premium_result)
   ```

## üè¶ Insurance Purchase & Certificate Generation Flow

### Advanced PDF Generation Process

The certificate generation demonstrates the full power of the MCP integration:

1. **Purchase Intent Recognition**
   ```python
   # User: "Help me apply for crop insurance with these premium details"
   # LLM determines: wants_insurance_purchase = True
   # Action: generate_certificate
   ```

2. **Parameter Validation**
   ```python
   # Validate required parameters
   if not all([farmer_name, crop, area_hectare, state]):
       raise ValueError("Missing required parameters")
   ```

3. **MCP Certificate Generation**
   ```python
   # Prepare simplified certificate data
   certificate_payload = {
       "name": "generate_insurance_certificate",
       "arguments": {
           "farmer_name": farmer_name,
           "state": state,
           "area_hectare": area_hectare,
           "crop": crop,
           "disease": disease
       }
   }
   ```

4. **PDF Generation & Storage**
   ```python
   # MCP server generates PDF certificate
   mcp_response = {
       "content": [
           {
               "type": "text",
               "text": "Certificate generated successfully"
           },
           {
               "type": "resource",
               "mimeType": "application/pdf",
               "uri": "data:application/pdf;base64:...",
               "name": "insurance_certificate_POL-ABC123.pdf"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

## üéØ Advanced Features

### 1. Infinite Loop Prevention

The system implements sophisticated loop prevention mechanisms:

```python
# Track repeated messages
last_insurance_message = state.get("last_insurance_message")
insurance_action_count = state.get("insurance_action_count", 0)

if last_insurance_message == user_message:
    insurance_action_count += 1
    if insurance_action_count >= 3:
        # Break the loop and redirect user
        return "I'm having trouble processing your request. Could you please rephrase?"
```

### 2. Context-Aware Disambiguation

The system handles complex disambiguation scenarios:

| User Input | Detected Intent | Action | Reasoning |
|------------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| "How much does it cost to buy insurance?" | `wants_insurance_premium` | `calculate_premium` | Asking about cost, not ready to purchase |
| "Buy insurance with this cost" | `wants_insurance_purchase` | `generate_certificate` | Ready to purchase with known cost |
| "Help me apply for insurance" | `wants_insurance_purchase` | `generate_certificate` | Direct application request |
| "Which companies are available?" | `wants_insurance_companies` | `get_companies` | Information request about providers |

### 3. Error Handling & Resilience

Comprehensive error handling ensures system reliability:

```python
# Circuit breaker pattern for MCP calls
class MCPClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(
            failure_threshold=5,
            recovery_timeout=30,
            expected_exception=requests.RequestException
        )
    
    @circuit_breaker
    async def call_mcp_tool(self, tool_name: str, **kwargs):
        # Robust MCP calling with automatic retry
        pass
```

### 4. Real-time Streaming

The system provides real-time feedback to users:

```python
# Stream processing status
add_message_to_state(state, "assistant", 
    "üè¶ Processing your insurance request... This may take a moment.")
state["stream_immediately"] = True

# Stream results as they become available
stream_insurance_response(premium_details)
```
