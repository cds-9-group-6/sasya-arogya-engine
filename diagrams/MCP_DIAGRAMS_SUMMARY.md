## üéØ Diagram Descriptions for Reports

### MCP Integration Architecture
The MCP Integration Architecture diagram presents the complete technical integration between the LangGraph finite state machine workflow engine and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, showcasing a multi-layered architecture from client applications to external data sources. The visualization demonstrates clear data flow through the FastAPI server, LangGraph FSM engine, intent analysis system, and MCP server tools, with dedicated layers for external services and data processing. Each layer is color-coded and properly spaced to ensure readability, with straight arrows indicating primary data flow paths and clear separation between client, engine, MCP, and external service layers. This diagram serves as the foundational reference for understanding the complete system integration and service communication patterns.

### Insurance Premium Calculation Flow
The Insurance Premium Calculation Flow diagram illustrates the complete sequence of operations for calculating crop insurance premiums, from user input through MCP server processing to final response delivery. The visualization shows 12 distinct interaction steps including user input processing, LangGraph FSM routing, LLM-powered intent analysis, MCP server communication, premium calculation with government subsidies, and result streaming. The diagram uses clear participant labels and detailed annotations to show the decision flow from user request through intent disambiguation, context extraction, MCP tool execution, and premium calculation with subsidy application. This sequence diagram ensures comprehensive understanding of the premium calculation process and serves as technical documentation for developers and business stakeholders.

### Insurance Purchase Flow
The Insurance Purchase Flow diagram details the complete sequence of operations for insurance purchase and certificate generation, demonstrating the sophisticated integration between LangGraph workflow management and MCP server PDF generation capabilities. The visualization shows 12 distinct interaction steps including purchase intent recognition, policy data generation with unique identifiers, MCP server certificate generation, database storage, and PDF delivery. The diagram employs clear participant separation and detailed process annotations to show the complete flow from user purchase request through policy creation, certificate generation, and final delivery. This sequence diagram provides comprehensive documentation for the insurance purchase process and serves as a reference for understanding the complete certificate generation workflow.

### LangGraph-MCP Integration
The LangGraph-MCP Integration diagram presents the technical architecture patterns for integrating LangGraph's finite state machine workflow engine with the Model Context Protocol server, showcasing the sophisticated agentic integration that enables intelligent crop insurance operations. The visualization shows five distinct architectural layers including the LangGraph FSM workflow, intent analysis system, MCP integration layer, MCP server tools, and external data sources, with clear data flow connections between each layer. The diagram uses color-coded layers and straight arrows to demonstrate the integration patterns, service communication flows, and data processing pathways that enable autonomous decision-making and context-aware processing. This architecture diagram serves as the technical foundation for understanding how LangGraph and MCP work together to deliver intelligent agricultural insurance services.
