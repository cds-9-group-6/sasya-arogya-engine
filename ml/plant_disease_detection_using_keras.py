# Let's assume the output of the ViT model before the classification head is a flat vector
# and we can add our classification layer on top of that.

# Let's define a simple model structure for fine-tuning:
# Input -> ViTModel (pretrained) -> Dense (for classification)

# Since the loaded model is TFViTForImageClassification, it already has a classification head.
# We need to replace its classification head with a new one that matches our number of classes.

# Get the base ViT model (without the classification head)

# Let's assume the base model is accessible via an attribute like `vit` or `base_model`
# If not, we might need to rebuild the model layer by layer excluding the last layer.

# Let's try accessing the base model assuming a common structure:
# If the model structure is not as expected, we might need to adjust this.

# Let's assume the loaded model `vit_model` can be used as a layer directly
# and we can access its output before the final classification layer.
# However, TFViTForImageClassification is designed to output classification logits.

# A more standard fine-tuning approach with Hugging Face models is to load the model

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The fine-tuned Vision Transformer model (`vit_attention_model`) successfully outputted attention weights along with classification logits.

*   After averaging across heads and extracting attention from the CLS token to the patches, the attention maps for each layer were successfully reshaped into a `(14, 14)` grid, matching the spatial arrangement of the image patches.
*   Overlaying the upsampled attention maps onto the original image revealed where the model's attention was concentrated in selected layers (1, 4, 7, 10, and 12) for the example image.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The visualizations show that different layers of the ViT model appear to focus attention on different spatial locations within the image, which is expected in hierarchical feature extraction.
*   Further analysis could involve quantifying the attention weights for specific image regions or object categories to better understand the model's decision-making process.

*   The upsampled attention map was successfully overlaid onto the original image using a colormap and transparency, and the resulting visualization was displayed.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The visualization provides insight into which regions of the image the attention mechanism focused on during processing. Further analysis could involve comparing attention maps for different classes or different examples to understand the model's learned attention patterns.

"""## Visualize feature maps

### Subtask:
Visualize feature maps

## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   An example image was selected and prepared from the training dataset (`x_train`), resulting in a preprocessed image with a shape of (1, 28, 28, 1), suitable for input into the attention-based CNN model.
*   The `attention_cnn_model` was successfully adapted to output the feature maps from all its layers by creating a new Keras `Model`.
*   Feature maps for the selected example image were predicted using the adapted model.
*   Visualization of feature maps was implemented, specifically targeting and displaying the output of the convolutional layers.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Analyze the visualized feature maps to gain deeper insights into what features each layer and filter are learning to detect.
*   Extend the visualization to include other relevant layers, such as the attention layer, to understand its impact on the feature maps.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

* The dataset was successfully prepared for binary classification (leaf/no leaf) by mapping original class labels to the new binary labels.
* Memory constraints were effectively managed by utilizing `ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_directory()` to load images in batches during training and validation, avoiding the need to load the entire dataset into memory.
* A deep learning model based on a pre-trained MobileNetV2 was defined and compiled for binary classification.
* The model was trained using the memory-efficient data generators with an Early Stopping callback set to monitor validation accuracy.
* The training stopped early as the validation accuracy reached a high threshold, indicating good learning.
* The trained model achieved a high validation accuracy of **{{accuracy*100:.2f}}%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying images as containing a leaf or not.

### Insights or Next Steps

* The high validation accuracy suggests that the model is performing very well on this binary classification task.
* **Prediction on New Images**: The trained `model_leaf_classification` can now be used to predict whether new, unseen images contain a leaf.
* **Integrate with Bounding Box Prediction (Future Work)**: If a dataset with bounding box annotations becomes available, the bounding box prediction branch could be added back to the model, and the model could be trained for both tasks simultaneously to achieve the original goal of detecting and localizing leaves.
* **Deployment**: The saved model (`leaf_classification_model.h5`) can be deployed to classify images in a real-world application.

Create a new code to create a deep learning model to determine if an image contains a leaf using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model. Use the same dataset as before, with label classes "unknown" and "with leaf". Optimize image and data loading using generators to handle low RAM. Implement early stopping to stop training when validation accuracy exceeds 95%. Save the trained model in .h5 format.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

* The dataset was successfully prepared for binary classification (leaf/no leaf) by mapping original class labels to the new binary labels.
* Memory constraints were effectively managed by utilizing `ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_directory()` to load images in batches during training and validation, avoiding the need to load the entire dataset into memory.
* A deep learning model based on a pre-trained MobileNetV2 was defined and compiled for binary classification.
* The model was trained using the memory-efficient data generators with an Early Stopping callback set to monitor validation accuracy.
* The training stopped early as the validation accuracy reached a high threshold, indicating good learning.
* The trained model achieved a high validation accuracy of **{{accuracy*100:.2f}}%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying images as containing a leaf or not.

### Insights or Next Steps

* The high validation accuracy suggests that the model is performing very well on this binary classification task.
* **Prediction on New Images**: The trained `model_leaf_classification` can now be used to predict whether new, unseen images contain a leaf.
* **Integrate with Bounding Box Prediction (Future Work)**: If a dataset with bounding box annotations becomes available, the bounding box prediction branch could be added back to the model, and the model could be trained for both tasks simultaneously to achieve the original goal of detecting and localizing leaves.
* **Deployment**: The saved model (`leaf_classification_model.h5`) can be deployed to classify images in a real-world application.
