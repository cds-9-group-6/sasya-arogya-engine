# Prescription Session History Integration Fix

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**

### **User Report**: 
*"Nope the followup node again asked for uploading the image despite previous classification state being available. Use the session history and previous classification state to prescribe even if coming from followup node. It might be better to put this code in prescribe node"*

### **Problem**: 
The followup node was asking users to upload an image for classification even when classification results were already available in the session history from previous interactions. This created a poor user experience where users had to repeatedly upload the same plant image.

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **The Core Issues**:

1. **Followup Node Responsibility Overload**:
   - Followup node was trying to check for classification results
   - Logic was incomplete - only checked current state, not session history
   - Inappropriate image upload requests when classification existed in session

2. **Session History Ignored**:
   - Classification results from previous conversation turns were not being searched
   - No mechanism to extract disease information from assistant message history
   - State wasn't being properly preserved across workflow executions

3. **Architectural Problem**:
   - Classification checks scattered across multiple nodes
   - Inconsistent logic between followup and prescribing nodes
   - No single source of truth for classification requirements

### **User Experience Impact**:
```
User: [Uploads plant image]
Bot: "🔬 Diagnosis: Alternaria leaf blotch (98% confidence)"

User: "What treatment do you recommend?"
Bot: "📸 Please upload an image..." ❌ BAD - ignores previous classification!

Expected:
Bot: "💊 Based on your Alternaria leaf blotch diagnosis..." ✅ GOOD
```

## ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **🔧 Architectural Redesign**

**User's Suggestion Implemented**: *"It might be better to put this code in prescribe node"*

#### **1. Simplified Followup Node**:
**File**: `core/nodes/followup_node.py` - `_handle_prescribe_action()`

**BEFORE (Complex, Broken)**:
```python
async def _handle_prescribe_action(self, state: WorkflowState) -> None:
    if state.get("classification_results"):
        # Classification available - route to prescribing node
        state["next_action"] = "prescribe"
    else:
        # Ask for image upload ❌ PROBLEM: Doesn't check session history!
        state["next_action"] = "classify_first"
        add_message_to_state(state, "assistant", "🔬 I need to classify the disease first. Please upload an image...")
        state["requires_user_input"] = True
```

**AFTER (Simple, Always Routes)**:
```python
async def _handle_prescribe_action(self, state: WorkflowState) -> None:
    """Handle prescription action - always route to prescribing node, let it handle classification checks"""
    logger.info("💊 Routing to prescribing node for prescription processing")
    state["next_action"] = "prescribe"  # Always route, let prescribing node handle everything
```

#### **2. Enhanced Prescribing Node with Smart Session Search**:
**File**: `core/nodes/prescribing_node.py` - `execute()` method

**NEW LOGIC**:
```python
async def execute(self, state: WorkflowState) -> WorkflowState:
    # Check for classification results in current state or session history
    classification_results = self._get_classification_from_session(state)
    
    if not classification_results:
        logger.info("⚠️ No classification results found in session - requesting classification")
        self._request_classification_for_prescription(state)
        return state
    
    # Update state with classification results if found in session history
    if not state.get("classification_results"):
        state["classification_results"] = classification_results
        logger.info(f"📋 Retrieved classification from session history: {classification_results.get('disease', 'Unknown')}")
    
    # Proceed with prescription generation...
```

### **🔧 Smart Session History Search Implementation**

#### **Multi-Source Classification Search**:
**File**: `core/nodes/prescribing_node.py` - `_get_classification_from_session()`

```python
def _get_classification_from_session(self, state: WorkflowState) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get classification results from current state or session history"""
    
    # 1. First check current state (highest priority)
    classification_results = state.get("classification_results")
    if classification_results:
        logger.info("📋 Found classification results in current state")
        return classification_results
    
    # 2. Check session history for previous classification
    messages = state.get("messages", [])
    
    # Look for assistant messages that mention disease classification
    for message in reversed(messages):  # Start from most recent
        if message.get("role") == "assistant":
            content = message.get("content", "")
            
            # Check for classification patterns
            if ("diagnosis" in content.lower() or 
                "disease detected" in content.lower() or
                "classification result" in content.lower() or
                "confidence" in content.lower()):
                
                # Try to extract classification info from the message
                classification_info = self._extract_classification_from_message(content)
                if classification_info:
                    logger.info(f"📋 Extracted classification from session history: {classification_info}")
                    return classification_info
    
    # 3. Check if there are stored results in other state keys
    disease_name = state.get("disease_name")
    if disease_name:
        logger.info(f"📋 Found disease name in state: {disease_name}")
        return {
            "disease": disease_name,
            "confidence": state.get("confidence", 0.8),
            "severity": state.get("severity", "moderate")
        }
    
    return None  # No classification found anywhere
```

#### **Advanced Regex-Based Text Extraction**:
**File**: `core/nodes/prescribing_node.py` - `_extract_classification_from_message()`

```python
def _extract_classification_from_message(self, content: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract classification information from assistant message content"""
    import re
    
    # Robust disease name patterns that handle markdown formatting
    disease_patterns = [
        r"diagnosis[:\s]+([^\n\(]+?)(?:\s*\(|$)",  # "Diagnosis: Disease Name" 
        r"disease[:\s]+([^\n\(]+?)(?:\s*\(|$)",    # "Disease: Disease Name"
        r"detected[:\s]+([^\n\(]+?)(?:\s*\(|$)",   # "Detected: Disease Name"
        r"identified[:\s]+([^\n\(]+?)(?:\s*\(|$)", # "Identified: Disease Name"
        r"\*\*([^*\n]+)\*\*",                      # "**Disease Name**" (markdown bold)
        r"disease detected[:\s]+([^\n\(]+?)(?:\s*\(|$)",
        r"🔬[^:]*diagnosis[:\s]*([^\n\(]+?)(?:\s*\(|$)"  # "🔬 **Diagnosis: Disease**"
    ]
    
    # Confidence extraction patterns
    confidence_patterns = [
        r"confidence[:\s]*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)",
        r"(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*%\s*confidence",
        r"(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*confidence"
    ]
    
    # Extract and return structured data
    if extracted_disease:
        cleaned_disease = extracted_disease.strip().rstrip("*.,!?")  # Clean markdown artifacts
        return {
            "disease": cleaned_disease,
            "confidence": extracted_confidence or 0.8,
            "severity": "moderate"
        }
```

#### **Graceful Classification Request**:
**File**: `core/nodes/prescribing_node.py` - `_request_classification_for_prescription()`

```python
def _request_classification_for_prescription(self, state: WorkflowState) -> None:
    """Request classification before prescription can be provided"""
    
    # Check if there's an image in the current request
    if state.get("user_image"):
        # Image available - route to classification
        state["next_action"] = "classify"
        add_message_to_state(state, "assistant", 
            "🔬 I'll first analyze your plant image to identify the disease, then provide treatment recommendations.")
    else:
        # No image - request image upload
        state["next_action"] = "followup"  # Go back to followup to handle image request
        add_message_to_state(state, "assistant",
            "📸 To provide treatment recommendations, I need to first identify the plant disease. Please upload a clear image of the affected leaf or plant part.")
    
    state["requires_user_input"] = not state.get("user_image", False)
```
