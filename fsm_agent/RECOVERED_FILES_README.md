## Recently Recovered Files

### Core Functionality Tests

**`test_state_persistence.py`** - Tests session state persistence functionality
- Verifies that conversation state is saved and loaded correctly
- Tests that classification results persist across requests  
- Ensures users don't need to re-upload images for followup questions

**`test_dosage_intent_fix.py`** - Tests the dosage intent analysis fix
- Verifies that "Yes give me dosage" is handled as a followup question
- Tests that existing prescription data is used instead of requesting new classification
- Ensures detailed dosage information is provided directly

**`test_streaming_response_fix.py`** - Tests streaming response functionality  
- Verifies that assistant responses (weather tips, dosage info) are properly streamed
- Tests routing logic to prevent infinite loops
- Ensures direct responses are streamed back to users immediately

**`debug_session_manager.py`** - Debug utility for session management
- Step-by-step debugging of session loading functionality
- Verifies session isolation between different session IDs
- Helpful for troubleshooting session persistence issues

## How to Use These Files

### Run Individual Tests
```bash
# Test session persistence
python3 test_state_persistence.py

# Test dosage intent fix  
python3 test_dosage_intent_fix.py

# Test streaming responses
python3 test_streaming_response_fix.py

# Debug session manager
python3 debug_session_manager.py
```

### Test Results
- ✅ **Exit Code 0**: Test passed successfully
- ❌ **Exit Code 1**: Test failed, check logs for details

## Key Issues These Tests Address

1. **Session Persistence Issue**: Conversations not continuing across requests
   - **Fixed**: Session state is now properly saved and loaded
   - **Test**: `test_state_persistence.py`

2. **Dosage Intent Analysis Issue**: "Yes give me dosage" treated as new classification request
   - **Fixed**: Initial node detects continuing conversations and routes to followup
   - **Test**: `test_dosage_intent_fix.py`

3. **Streaming Response Issue**: Weather tips/dosage responses not streamed back
   - **Fixed**: Assistant responses are now properly streamed with correct routing
   - **Test**: `test_streaming_response_fix.py`

4. **KeyError: 'followup'**: LangGraph routing error  
   - **Fixed**: Invalid routing destinations corrected to prevent KeyErrors
   - **Verified**: All routing destinations are now valid

## Architecture Overview

The FSM Agent uses:
- **LangGraph**: For workflow state management and routing
- **Session Manager**: For persistent conversation state across requests
- **Node Factory**: For modular, maintainable node architecture  
- **Streaming**: For real-time response delivery

Each test file validates a specific component of this architecture to ensure robust functionality.
