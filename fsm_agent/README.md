üìù Here are some additional things that might interest you:
1. Would you like to know about vendors or suppliers who can provide these treatments?
2. Do you need detailed application instructions or dosage information?  
3. Would you like information about crop insurance options to protect your investment?"
```

## Intelligent Follow-Up System üéØ

The FSM agent features an advanced follow-up system that provides contextual suggestions when workflows complete, helping farmers discover additional relevant services and information.

### How It Works

1. **Context Analysis**: When a workflow reaches the completed state, the system analyzes:
   - Previous workflow state (classification, prescription, vendor query)
   - User context (location, plant type, season, growth stage)
   - Conversation history to avoid repetition
   - User intent indicators from previous interactions

2. **Smart Suggestions**: Generates up to 3 relevant follow-up questions based on:
   - **After Classification**: Treatment options, prevention tips, general plant care
   - **After Prescription**: Vendor information, application instructions, dosage details
   - **After Vendor Query**: Application timing, progress monitoring, follow-up care

3. **Deduplication**: Automatically filters out topics already discussed by analyzing conversation history for relevant keywords

### Follow-Up Examples by State

#### After Classification
```
üå± Workflow completed successfully!

üìù Here are some additional things that might interest you:
1. Would you like specific treatment recommendations for this disease?
2. Would you like to know how to prevent this disease in the future?
3. Are you interested in seasonal care tips for summer?
```

#### After Prescription  
```
üå± Workflow completed successfully!

üìù Here are some additional things that might interest you:
1. Would you like to know about vendors or suppliers who can provide these treatments?
2. Do you need detailed application instructions or dosage information?
3. Would you like information about crop insurance options to protect your investment?
```

#### After Vendor Search
```
üå± Workflow completed successfully!

üìù Here are some additional things that might interest you:
1. Would you like guidance on the best timing and method for applying treatments?
2. Would you like to know how to monitor treatment progress and follow-up care?
3. Are you interested in soil health assessment or nutrient management tips?
```

### Context-Aware Suggestions

The system also provides personalized suggestions based on user context:

- **Location-based**: Weather recommendations for specific regions
- **Plant-specific**: Care tips tailored to the identified plant type
- **Season-aware**: Seasonal advice and timing recommendations
- **Technical interests**: Detailed analysis options for users wanting deeper insights
- **Commercial interests**: Market insights, insurance options, and business aspects

### API Integration

Follow-up suggestions are automatically included in completion responses:

**Streaming Response:**
```
event: state_update
data: {
  "current_node": "completed",
  "assistant_response": "üå± Workflow completed successfully!\n\nüìù Here are some additional things that might interest you:\n1. Would you like to know about vendors...",
  "is_complete": true
}
```

**JSON Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "üå± Workflow completed successfully!\n\nüìù Here are some additional things that might interest you:\n1. Would you like to know about vendors who can provide these treatments?\n2. Do you need detailed application instructions?\n3. Would you like crop insurance information?",
  "session_id": "session_123",
  "current_state": "completed"
}
```

### Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Proactively suggests relevant next steps
- **Increased Engagement**: Helps users discover additional valuable services
- **Contextual Relevance**: Suggestions tailored to specific user journey and needs
- **Conversation Continuity**: Seamless transition from completion to new topics
- **Smart Filtering**: Avoids repetition and information overload

## Attention Overlay Functionality üéØ

The FSM agent includes a dedicated **AttentionOverlayTool** that allows users to retrieve and view attention visualizations from previous classifications without needing to re-run the analysis.

### How It Works

1. **During Classification**: When the CNN classifies a plant disease, it generates an attention overlay showing which parts of the image were most important for the diagnosis
2. **Stored in Session**: The base64-encoded attention overlay is automatically stored in the session state
3. **On-Demand Retrieval**: Users can request to view the overlay at any time during the conversation

### Usage Examples

Users can request attention overlays using natural language:

```
User: "show me the attention overlay"
User: "can I see the attention map?"
User: "display the heatmap" 
User: "show me where the AI was looking"
User: "what parts of the image were important?"
User: "attention overlay info"
User: "explain the attention overlay"
```

### API Integration

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "show attention overlay",
  "session_id": "existing-session-with-classification"
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "response": "üéØ **Attention Overlay for Tomato Late Blight**\n\n**Confidence:** 92.50%\n**Overlay Format:** Base64 encoded image\n\n**Attention Overlay Data:**\niVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAY...\n\nüí° **Usage:** Display this as an overlay on your original image to see where the AI focused its attention.",
  "session_id": "session-123",
  "current_state": "followup"
}
```

### Implementation Details

The attention overlay functionality is handled by the **FOLLOWUP** state, which detects overlay-related keywords and:

1. ‚úÖ **Retrieves** the stored attention data from session state
2. üîç **Validates** that classification results exist
3. üì§ **Returns** the base64-encoded overlay image
4. ‚ùå **Handles errors** gracefully when no overlay is available

### Error Handling

- **No Classification**: Prompts user to perform classification first
- **No Overlay**: Explains that overlay generation may have failed
- **Session Issues**: Suggests starting a new classification session

### Testing

Run the attention overlay test suite:
```bash
cd engine/fsm_agent/tests
./test_attention_overlay.sh
```

This test verifies:
- ‚úÖ Overlay retrieval after successful classification
- ‚ùå Error handling for no-classification scenarios  
- üì° Streaming overlay responses
- üîç Base64 data format validation

### Streaming Test with Real Images

Run the comprehensive streaming test with real plant disease images:
```bash
cd engine/fsm_agent/tests
./test_fsm_streaming_with_image.sh
```

This test validates:
- üåä **Real-time streaming responses** with actual plant disease images
- üîÑ **LangGraph state transitions** through the complete workflow
- üî¨ **CNN classification** with status message parsing
- üíä **RAG-based prescriptions** with plant-specific recommendations
- üéØ **Attention overlay requests** from stored session data
- üè™ **Vendor recommendations** and interaction flow
- üí¨ **Followup conversations** with contextual responses
- üóÑÔ∏è **Session persistence** and state management

## Extending the Agent

### Adding New States

1. **Create State Node Function**
   ```python
   async def _my_new_state_node(self, state: WorkflowState) -> WorkflowState:
       # State logic here
       return state
   ```

2. **Add to Workflow**
   ```python
   workflow.add_node("my_new_state", self._my_new_state_node)
   ```

3. **Add Routing**
   ```python
   workflow.add_conditional_edges(
       "previous_state",
       self._route_to_new_state,
       {"my_new_state": "my_new_state"}
   )
   ```

### Adding New Tools

1. **Create Tool Class**
   ```python
   class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
       name = "my_custom_tool"
       description = "My custom tool description"
       
       def _run(self, **kwargs):
           # Tool logic here
           return result
   ```

2. **Register Tool**
   ```python
   self.tools["my_custom_tool"] = MyCustomTool()
   ```

3. **Use in State**
   ```python
   tool_result = await self.tools["my_custom_tool"].run(input_data)
   ```
