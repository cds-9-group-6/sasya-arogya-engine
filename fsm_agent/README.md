## 🏦 Advanced Insurance System

The FSM agent features a sophisticated **insurance node** with LLM-powered intent disambiguation that supports comprehensive crop insurance services through seamless MCP server integration.

### Key Insurance Features

#### **🤖 LLM-Powered Intent Disambiguation**
The insurance system uses advanced LangChain `ChatPromptTemplate` with user-provided examples to accurately distinguish between:

- **Premium Calculation**: "What is the cost of premium for my wheat farm?"
- **Policy Purchase**: "Help me apply for crop insurance"  
- **Company Information**: "Which insurance companies are available?"
- **Coverage Analysis**: "What does insurance cover?"

#### **🎯 Intelligent Action Routing**
```python
# Example of how the system routes different intents
"Help me apply for crop insurance" → wants_insurance_purchase: true → generate_certificate
"What is the cost of premium?" → wants_insurance_premium: true → calculate_premium
"Which companies are available?" → wants_insurance_companies: true → get_companies
```

#### **🔄 Complete Purchase Flow**
The system supports end-to-end insurance workflows:

1. **Intent Analysis** - LLM determines user's specific insurance need
2. **Context Extraction** - Gathers crop, area, location, and farmer information
3. **MCP Integration** - Calls appropriate insurance service tools
4. **Certificate Generation** - Creates PDF policy documents with digital signatures
5. **Response Streaming** - Real-time updates throughout the process

### Insurance Workflow Examples

#### **Premium Calculation Flow**
```
User: "What is the cost of premium for my 5 hectare wheat farm in Punjab?"
  ↓
[FOLLOWUP] → LLM Analysis → wants_insurance_premium: true
  ↓
[INSURANCE] → Extract Context (crop: wheat, area: 5, state: Punjab)
  ↓
[INSURANCE] → MCP Call → calculate_premium(crop="wheat", area=5, state="Punjab")
  ↓
[INSURANCE] → Stream Response → Premium: ₹8,500, Subsidy: 40%
  ↓
[COMPLETED] → Follow-up suggestions for purchase or company comparison
```

#### **Insurance Purchase Flow**
```
User: "Help me apply for crop insurance with these premium details"
  ↓
[FOLLOWUP] → LLM Analysis → wants_insurance_purchase: true
  ↓
[INSURANCE] → Extract Context (farmer, crop, area, state)
  ↓
[INSURANCE] → MCP Call → generate_insurance_certificate(...)
  ↓
[INSURANCE] → Stream Response → PDF Certificate + Policy Number
  ↓
[COMPLETED] → Confirmation with policy details and next steps
```

This advanced insurance system transforms the FSM agent into a comprehensive agricultural insurance platform, providing farmers with intelligent, context-aware insurance services through sophisticated AI-driven workflows.

## Intelligent Follow-Up System 🎯

The FSM agent features an advanced follow-up system that provides contextual suggestions when workflows complete, helping farmers discover additional relevant services and information.

### How It Works

1. **Context Analysis**: When a workflow reaches the completed state, the system analyzes:
   - Previous workflow state (classification, prescription, vendor query)
   - User context (location, plant type, season, growth stage)
   - Conversation history to avoid repetition
   - User intent indicators from previous interactions

2. **Smart Suggestions**: Generates up to 3 relevant follow-up questions based on:
   - **After Classification**: Treatment options, prevention tips, general plant care
   - **After Prescription**: Vendor information, application instructions, dosage details
   - **After Vendor Query**: Application timing, progress monitoring, follow-up care

3. **Deduplication**: Automatically filters out topics already discussed by analyzing conversation history for relevant keywords

### Follow-Up Examples by State

#### After Classification

- **Plant-specific**: Care tips tailored to the identified plant type
- **Season-aware**: Seasonal advice and timing recommendations
- **Technical interests**: Detailed analysis options for users wanting deeper insights
- **Commercial interests**: Market insights, insurance options, and business aspects

### API Integration

Follow-up suggestions are automatically included in completion responses:

**Streaming Response:**
```
event: state_update
data: {
  "current_node": "completed",
  "assistant_response": "🌱 Workflow completed successfully!\n\n📝 Here are some additional things that might interest you:\n1. Would you like to know about vendors...",
  "is_complete": true
}
```

**JSON Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "🌱 Workflow completed successfully!\n\n📝 Here are some additional things that might interest you:\n1. Would you like to know about vendors who can provide these treatments?\n2. Do you need detailed application instructions?\n3. Would you like crop insurance information?",
  "session_id": "session_123",
  "current_state": "completed"
}
```

### Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Proactively suggests relevant next steps
- **Increased Engagement**: Helps users discover additional valuable services
- **Contextual Relevance**: Suggestions tailored to specific user journey and needs
- **Conversation Continuity**: Seamless transition from completion to new topics
- **Smart Filtering**: Avoids repetition and information overload

## Attention Overlay Functionality 🎯

The FSM agent includes a dedicated **AttentionOverlayTool** that allows users to retrieve and view attention visualizations from previous classifications without needing to re-run the analysis.

### How It Works

1. **During Classification**: When the CNN classifies a plant disease, it generates an attention overlay showing which parts of the image were most important for the diagnosis
2. **Stored in Session**: The base64-encoded attention overlay is automatically stored in the session state
3. **On-Demand Retrieval**: Users can request to view the overlay at any time during the conversation

### Usage Examples

Users can request attention overlays using natural language:

```
User: "show me the attention overlay"
User: "can I see the attention map?"
User: "display the heatmap" 
User: "show me where the AI was looking"
User: "what parts of the image were important?"
User: "attention overlay info"
User: "explain the attention overlay"
```

### API Integration

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "show attention overlay",
  "session_id": "existing-session-with-classification"
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "response": "🎯 **Attention Overlay for Tomato Late Blight**\n\n**Confidence:** 92.50%\n**Overlay Format:** Base64 encoded image\n\n**Attention Overlay Data:**\niVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAY...\n\n💡 **Usage:** Display this as an overlay on your original image to see where the AI focused its attention.",
  "session_id": "session-123",
  "current_state": "followup"
}
```

### Implementation Details

The attention overlay functionality is handled by the **FOLLOWUP** state, which detects overlay-related keywords and:

1. ✅ **Retrieves** the stored attention data from session state
2. 🔍 **Validates** that classification results exist
3. 📤 **Returns** the base64-encoded overlay image
4. ❌ **Handles errors** gracefully when no overlay is available

### Error Handling

- **No Classification**: Prompts user to perform classification first
- **No Overlay**: Explains that overlay generation may have failed
- **Session Issues**: Suggests starting a new classification session

### Testing

Run the attention overlay test suite:
```bash
cd engine/fsm_agent/tests
./test_attention_overlay.sh
```

This test verifies:
- ✅ Overlay retrieval after successful classification
- ❌ Error handling for no-classification scenarios  
- 📡 Streaming overlay responses
- 🔍 Base64 data format validation

### Streaming Test with Real Images

Run the comprehensive streaming test with real plant disease images:
```bash
cd engine/fsm_agent/tests
./test_fsm_streaming_with_image.sh
```

This test validates:
- 🌊 **Real-time streaming responses** with actual plant disease images
- 🔄 **LangGraph state transitions** through the complete workflow
- 🔬 **CNN classification** with status message parsing
- 💊 **RAG-based prescriptions** with plant-specific recommendations
- 🎯 **Attention overlay requests** from stored session data
- 🏪 **Vendor recommendations** and interaction flow
- 💬 **Followup conversations** with contextual responses
- 🗄️ **Session persistence** and state management
